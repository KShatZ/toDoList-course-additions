This is a small little project to practice some node.js (express) and ejs templating. 

Using the boilerplate styles provided by Angela from App Brewery in her Web Development Course, I plan on adding on and editing some functionality in the To-Do list app.



Current Progress: 

| I have been able to add on the remove functionality to the to-do list. 
   - Learned a good deal about sending HTTP requests from client side, especially that you need the client to respond to the response of the server. This issue           caused me to be stuck for a while as the DOM was not reloading even though removal on the back-end was occuring flawlessly. 

   - Currently this functionality involves a page reload. This works and accomplishes the task fine, BUT not the best in terms of UX perspective. Will need to come       back to this and have the removal occuring in the client side with DOM maniupulation instead of a page reload and re-render of the EJS template.
